	<h2>Third Step Prayer</h2>
		<p>God, I offer myself to Thee - To build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. 
		Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. 
		Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness 
		to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. 
		May I do Thy will always!</p>
