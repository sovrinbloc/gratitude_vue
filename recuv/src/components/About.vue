    <h2>This Is Anonymous</h2>
  <p>This application was developed by Joseph A. The reason behind its development was to make simpler the vital process of doing several things that are integral to early sobriety, and to pave the solid foundation for long-term sobriety. </p>

  <p>There is much debate about what to do in order to remain abstainent. There are questions, arguments, truths, falacies, and everything in between. Using this application, we can decipher, once and for all, the correct measures that must be taken in order to kick the habit once and for all, and what it will take to remain clean and sober, one day at a time, for a lifetime. </p>

  <p>The data that we collect from this application is solely used to benefit those trying to remain clean and sober. No application or data similar to this exists. This is a revolutionary application to bring those suffering from the diseases of Alcoholism, Addiction, and related disorders, statistics that are proven through experience, to allow the person to make decisions based on data, rather than guessing. </p>

<h2>We beg of you</h2>
  <p>We beg of you. Please use this application in your day to day activities. Not only will this application help you to remain sober, but it will collect anonymous data from you so that over time we can provide plans for the suffering alcoholic / addict that are based on actual results.</p>
