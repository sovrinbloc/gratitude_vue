	content_intro: "On awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead. We consider our plans for \
	the day. Before we begin, we ask God to direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced \
	from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking motives. Under these conditions we can employ our \
	mental faculties with assurance, for after all God gave us brains to use. Our thought-life will be \
	placed on a much higher plane when our thinking is cleared of wrong motives. \
	In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not be able to determine \
	which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We \
	relax and take it easy. We don't struggle. We are often surprised how the right answers come \
	after we have tried this for a while. What used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration \
	gradually becomes a working part of the mind. Being still inexperienced and having just made \
	conscious contact with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired at all times. We \
	might pay for this presumption in all sorts of absurd actions and ideas. Nevertheless, we find that \
	our thinking will, as time passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration. We come to rely \
	upon it.",
		conclusion: "We usually conclude the period of meditation with a prayer that we be shown all through \
	the day what our next step is to be, that we be given whatever we need to take care of such \
	problems. We ask especially for freedom from self-will, and are careful to make no request for \
	ourselves only. We may ask for ourselves, however, if others will be helped. We are careful \
	never to pray for our own selfish ends. Many of us have wasted a lot of time doing that and it \
	doesn't work. You can easily see why. \
	If circumstances warrant, we ask our wives or friends to join us in morning meditation. If \
	we belong to a religious denomination which requires a definite morning devotion, we attend to \
	that also. If not members of religious bodies, we sometimes select and memorize a few set \
	prayers which emphasize the principles we have been discussing. There are many helpful books \
	also. Suggestions about these may be obtained from one's priest, minister, or rabbi. Be quick to \
	see where religious people are right. Make use of what they offer.\
	As we go through the day we pause, when agitated or doubtful, and ask for the right \
	thought or action. We constantly remind ourselves we are no longer running the show, humbly  \
	saying to ourselves many times each day 'Thy will be done.' We are then in much less danger of\
	excitement, fear, anger, worry, self-pity, or foolish decisions. We become much more efficient. \
	We do not tire so easily, for we are not burning up energy foolishly as we did when we were \
	trying to arrange life to suit ourselves. \
	It works - it really does. \
	We alcoholics are undisciplined. So we let God discipline us in the simple way we have \
	just outlined.",
